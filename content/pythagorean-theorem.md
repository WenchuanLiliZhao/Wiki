The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.

## Statement

In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Mathematically, if $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse, then:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Proof

There are many proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. One of the most elegant is based on similar triangles.

Consider a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and hypotenuse $c$. Draw an altitude $h$ from the right angle to the hypotenuse, creating two right triangles.

By similarity of triangles:
- $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{h}{b}$, so $ah = bc$
- $\frac{b}{c} = \frac{h}{a}$, so $bh = ac$

The area of the original triangle can be calculated as $\frac{1}{2}ab$, but also as the sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles: $\frac{1}{2}ch$.

This gives us:
$$\frac{1}{2}ab = \frac{1}{2}ch$$
$$ab = ch$$

Substituting our earlier results:
$$ab = c \cdot \frac{ab}{c} = ab$$

Which confirms our theorem.

## Applications

The Pythagorean theorem has numerous applications in:
- [[Distance Formula]]
- [[Vector Calculations]]
- [[Trigonometry]]

## Historical Context

The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]], though it was known to earlier civilizations including the Babylonians and Chinese.
